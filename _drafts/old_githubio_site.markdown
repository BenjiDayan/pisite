layout: page
title: Old Githubio Site
permalink: /Githubio/

At some point I tried to show a little frontend initiative by playing around with react: [https://benjidayan.github.io/random/](https://benjidayan.github.io/random/) - this is a link to a page on an old personal website I made. The dark magic powering this page has been lost to the sands of time, so I dare not try to figure out how to properly incorporate it into this new site.
