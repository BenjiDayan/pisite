## In pursuit of some highly desirable jobs

Some more semi-absurd job seeking tales:

For some job applications which I'm particularly keen on, not only will I craft a good cover letter, but I might also write the recruiters asking for updates given a long enough absence of updates.

On one really desirable job, I'd had an intial quick "screening" interview - just 15 minutes. When no further information came despite the promise of reply in ~ 2-3 weeks, I shot my two interviewers a message (This was a small team doing its own hiring). No response. A little confused/desperate, a few weeks later I sent another request for information. More weeks later there is still not a peep. "Ghosting" is somewhat common just off an initial application, but more unusual after having had an actual interview!

On another job (actually a research-style internship at a very reputable company) for which I thought I might have good chances, after waiting a number of weeks without any contact for an initils
al interview, I sent a request for updates. A quite quick update was what I got: an apologetic rejection (!). Thankfully this time, this was quickly followed up by an even more apologetic statement of error - and that they are actually still evaluating my application! I'm still waiting to see what will come of it :smile:.
