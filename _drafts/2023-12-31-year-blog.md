A goal with the blog was to increase intropsection / reflection / high level thinking, something which I hate.

One cannot spill all one's guts and darkest thoughts on a public blog, however. I guess keeping more personal posts in the `_drafts/` folder, and making sure to make the repo private on github is a good solution. Besides, blog posts should aim for positivity. Otherwise it would be counter-productive!

## Year in Brief

Rough chronology:
I broke up with Danae around February, end of Herbst exam season. I also polished off my last ETH exams - Probabilistic Methods, RandAlg, DLABNN and Principles of Macroeconomics. We also finished DS lab at some point.

I was looking for a thesis for quite a while, intially exploring doing it somewhere sunnier - Prof Bin Yu in Berkeley, and a range of other profs / labs mostly in the US? I think only Bin Yu (statistics) replied, and though was friendly had no actual physical lab space so it would have been remote. Why I hadn't thought of doing a thesis with Ryan I don't know, but when turning to ETH theses, I applied mostly to more mathematical labs. Some Game / Voting theory at DISCO? Guarantees for ML with Fanny Yang? However I was all round too hasty and rushed, and didn't fully wait for some to reply, although others never did. People I actually had talks with were Charlotte Bunne and Marc & Ulysse. I think I wanted to do something with freedom, not too ML-ey, and mathematical. Could I still walk a math road?

I picked M&U as they were friendlier, seemed to have a solid plan for what I should do, while still having a lot of flexibility for exploration in the topic. CB had some bad review from a student too, despite great charisma.

The thesis was a big grind.
- I should have done more literature review at the beginning.
  - When I was doing diffusion maps, I dove in a bit too gung-ho without reading enough. Although I did have an extensive search for the riemann manifold theory I needed/wanted
- Going off-piste with diffusion maps was maybe fun but also a bit frustrating as I lacked support, solid goals and directions
- Somehow I always felt a bit non-vibing with M&U / under-appreciated. They probably found me too needy

The theme of this post is data loss. The post is in fact a celebration of being able to post at all, as for 2-3 weeks the raspberry pi I host this site on was down! I shall tell the long, winding, and amateurish tale of my attempts to revive it, involving side quests to the lands of "google drive", "ubuntu" and, improbably, "baidu wangpan".
