I want to write blog posts; as with many other things I think a system/framework will help add structure to my posts and also make the act of posting easier in the first place.

My initial posts will undoubtedly be of poor quality and inconsistent style/content, however I will push through in order to build the writing habit.

## For what purpose do I want to write posts
- increase introspection
- improve writing skills
- have portfolio / about me that I can show to others for reputational boost

## Blogging framework ideas
- daily life absurdities: fun to share; simple and short anecdotes
- chronicle of job search, add some levity to the sometimes arduous task of applying. Sufficient anonymity must also be preserved!
<!-- help add structure to the job application life; aim to frame the situation positively. However a balance must be made, including some degree of anonymity. Unemployment chronicles are also sure to feature many stories leaning towards the absurd. -->
- more TBD?
