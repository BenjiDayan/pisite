*Trying on glasses in Taiwan* -->


I'm from the United Kingdom, and currently living in Zurich - I just finished a master's in datascience at ETH. 



## Blog?
I'm still figuring out the direction for my blog - see initial thoughts in [this meta blog post]({% post_url 2023-11-16-metapost %}).

<!-- ## Blog?
I haven't figured out what I'm doing with this "Blog". It may also serve as a personal website
Ideas I have:
- Keep site hosting on raspberry pi or move to github pages?
- Bring some of my old crappy javascript into the jekyll site?
- Set up live thermomemter on pi - display on site and or with a graph of recent temperatures
- Do a biweekly (?) blogging challenge to get a feel for it?
- Do a javascript project? -->

## Projects
Some select projects to show that I can code (currently seeking for a job). For a more comprehensive list see my [github](https://github.com/BenjiDayan).

### Unity Games

### Old Website


At some point I tried to show a little frontend initiative by playing around with react: [https://benjidayan.github.io/random/](https://benjidayan.github.io/random/) - this is a link to a page on an old personal website I made. The dark magic powering this page has been lost to the sands of time, so I dare not try to figure out how to properly incorporate it into this new site.
