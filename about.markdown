*Trying on glasses in Taiwan* -->


I'm from London, but am currently (summer 2025) based in Berkeley where I'm interning at an AI lab in the university.



## Blog
Of highly questionable quality. Initial thoughts on writing goals see [this meta blog post]({% post_url 2023-11-16-metapost %}).

<!-- ## Blog?
I haven't figured out what I'm doing with this "Blog". It may also serve as a personal website
Ideas I have:
- Keep site hosting on raspberry pi or move to github pages?
- Bring some of my old crappy javascript into the jekyll site?
- Set up live thermomemter on pi - display on site and or with a graph of recent temperatures
- Do a biweekly (?) blogging challenge to get a feel for it?
- Do a javascript project? -->

## Projects
Some select projects that I'm more proud of. For a more comprehensive list see my [Github](https://github.com/BenjiDayan).

#### Master's Thesis

On investigating the GIRG (geometric inhomogeneous random graphs) model's empirical fit to real life social network graphs. [Github repo](https://github.com/BenjiDayan/GIRGs). Fortunate to be able to together with my supervisors publish it as a [paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=xeSfmIIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=xeSfmIIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C)

#### Old Website


At some point I tried to show a little frontend initiative by playing around with react: [https://benjidayan.github.io/random/](https://benjidayan.github.io/random/)

 <!-- - this is a link to a page on an old personal website I made. The dark magic powering this page has been lost to the sands of time, so I dare not try to figure out how to properly incorporate it into this new site. -->
