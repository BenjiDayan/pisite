*Trying on glasses in Taiwan* -->

Hi! I'm an ML researcher / engineer. Most recently I worked on a project on Bayesian networks at CHAI in UC Berkeley; in 2024 I built LLM agents & infrastructure at [Finster AI](https://finster.ai) in London. Before this I enjoyed a 2 year datascience/AI master's at ETH Zurich where I focused on NLP and mathematical models for social networks. I'm broadly interested in language, cognition, interpretable computational methods and neurosymbolic AI.

Prior all of that, I did a math bachelors at the University of Cambridge, and grew up in London except a 1 year stint 2008-9 in Beijing!



### Blog
I aspirationally want to write / self-reflect more. I also document some fun projects, expound / research ideas. Posts are of mixed quality and content/topic!

<!-- ## Blog?
I haven't figured out what I'm doing with this "Blog". It may also serve as a personal website
Ideas I have:
- Keep site hosting on raspberry pi or move to github pages?
- Bring some of my old crappy javascript into the jekyll site?
- Set up live thermomemter on pi - display on site and or with a graph of recent temperatures
- Do a biweekly (?) blogging challenge to get a feel for it?
- Do a javascript project? -->

### GNN-Guided Block Selection in Gibbs MCMC

Bayesian networks (BNs) are great and interpretable, however exact/approximate inference can be intractably slow for large networks. We propose an automated block detection algorithm method to amortise inference time by training a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to propose Blocks (for blocked Gibbs MCMC) directly from a BNs structure.

At some point I tried to show a little frontend initiative by playing around with react: [https://benjidayan.github.io/random/](https://benjidayan.github.io/random/) -->
