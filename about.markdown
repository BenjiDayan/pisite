I haven't figured out what I'm doing with this "Blog". It may also serve as a personal website
Ideas I have:
- Keep site hosting on raspberry pi or move to github pages?
- Bring some of my old crappy javascript into the jekyll site?
- Set up live thermomemter on pi - display on site and or with a graph of recent temperatures
- Do a biweekly (?) blogging challenge to get a feel for it?
- Do a javascript project?
