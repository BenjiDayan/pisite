I promise that this blog will contain more than just trains and job applications! Both clearly take up too much real estate in my head, although the latter is perhaps more understandable.

## Deutschland-Ticket

A powerful sounding name, evoking national pride. Rightfully so, as for just â‚¬49 you can get a whole month of travel on regional trains and local public transport, in the whole of Germany! If the Deutsche Bahn were also more consistent, this ticket would be truly marvellous; it is already a fantastic deal. "American minds cannot comprehend"-able, my Switzerland residing mind is equally dazzled, juxtaposig it with the 50 CHF Swiss 24 hour train pass.

On the topic of unlimited transport passes, in my slightly over 2 years in Zurich, this month is the first time that I've bought the "Zone 110" month pass (~60 CHF). Though this only covers most of the important parts of Zurich, not nearly the whole of Germany, nonetheless the sense of freedom with which it imbues me is still remarkable! No longer must I carefully weigh up the physical exertion involved in biking back up the hill from the office against the cost of a tram ticket, nor calculate the chance of rain in the evening, ration the weight of shopping in my backpack, etc. Even just removing the need to faff around with the SBB app each time I get on the tram is a weight lifted from the mind. All this without even getting onto the haunting fear inflicted by the SBB ticket inspectors.

The sense of freedom from the travel pass, in particular of not having to weigh the cost/benefit of each tram journey, is actually a known economic phenomenon, some kind of "buffet effect". The removal of the real psychological annoyance of cost benefit analysis is a boon in of itself, and is one reason why people like buffets, or unlimited data plans.



## In pursuit of some highly desirable jobs

Some more semi-absurd job seeking tales:

For some job applications which I'm particularly keen on, not only will I anxiously craft a good cover letter, but I might also write the recruiters asking for updates given a long enough absence of updates.

On one really desirable job, I'd had an intial quick "screening" interview - just 15 minutes. When no further information came despite the promise of reply in ~ 2-3 weeks, I shot my two interviewers a message (This was a small team doing its own hiring). No response. A little confused/desperate, a few weeks later I sent another request for information. More weeks later there is still not a peep. "Ghosting" is somewhat common just off an initial application, but more unusual after having had an actual interview!

On another job (actually a research-style internship at a very reputable company) for which I thought I might have good chances, after waiting a number of weeks without any contact for an initils
al interview, I sent a request for updates. A quite quick update was what I got: an apologetic rejection (!). Thankfully this time, this was quickly followed up by an even more apologetic statement of error - and that they are actually still evaluating my application! I'm still waiting to see what will come of it :smile:.
